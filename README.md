<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![App screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://indagoodhandsdev.web.app/)

**ingoodhands** is a web application developed using .NET 7, Angular 15, Postgres and Auth0. The purpose of this application is to provide aid in the form of food, beverages and defensive equipment to Ukraine, which is currently facing war with Russia and receiving support from western countries. The application assumes that there are several warehouses located throughout Europe where these goods are stored.  

The application recognizes four types of users. The first one is the "Donor", who donates goods through the web application. They fill out a form by entering a list of gifts, choose a warehouse and either send a package themselves or deliver the gifts in person. The second user is the "Needy", who after logging in, places an order for specific goods, such as 100kg of rice in Ukraine.  

Each order can contain one or multiple deliveries that are an attempt to deliver the necessary goods. The third user is the "Warehouse Keeper", who receives gifts from donors and automatically compiles delivery orders generated by the system in the warehouse so they are ready for pick-up.   

The last user is the "Supplier", who after logging in, arrives at the warehouse with their own vehicle, picks up deliveries and strives to deliver them to those in need. In the case of successful delivery, the delivery is closed in the system and the order is optionally closed as well.
